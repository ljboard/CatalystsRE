voiceover types

charachterize coach more

more complication in coaches character
good dialogue for character building
more nonvocal
(ill do it because im your father, i dont believe you dont believe me)
ten1nsion building but resolves  without actual threat  make consequences mor e palpable


SHOULD I SCRAP THE ENDING VOICEOVER
MOTHER SUBPLOT

more interactions between other classmates, worldbuilding to make it feel more like a school
establish setting better, its hard to tell that this is 1974
the rhythm-- strong inciting incident, but weaker 2nd and 3rd act
more of joes action, less dialogue
ending was rushed

stakes and pressure, starts off with mother establishing that senior year is a big year
but we need more  to show that the stakes  have really been raised
we need  more development and foreshadowing for paul
show, dont tell and visually display things



more about getting into colleges, the football players want to get into college so thats how they depend on coach,
talk about how other players need coach, so thats why maybe he is conflicted about helping them
paul needs more foreshadowing
moment where abuse starts is unclear

good use of shame where pauls actions hide his disgust with his involvement
look more into why its

joe isnt the most compelling part of the script
he says we should care about the victims but doesnt show it

joe is faultless
we dont show him get into trouble
we need more conflict to show why hes looking through the  cabinets in coaches office

he needs to sit with the consequences more in the end

based on a true story
the culture of silence

show more of culture of silnece and why does joe not know before hand and

joe needs to be more defind, and the school needs more character, and show more how powerful in the school

tone is inconsistent , why is joe so invested in this investigation
(spotlight movie)

initially comes across  the photos  describe  them to add pressure to wh

rippple effect
show how  joe changes in class how other students have acted that maybe he didnt understand before


how does joes relationship with his family change
how does he get in trouble
does joe stop  going to class or doing his homework
